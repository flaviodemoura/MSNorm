(** * Introduction *)

(** It is well-known that termination is not a modular property for
    rewrite systems %\cite{toyama87}%.  A property $P$ of reduction
    relation systems is modular if given two systems $A$ and $B$, the
    property $P$ holds for the combined system built from $A$ and $B$
    whenever $P$ holds for both $A$ and $B$.  In other words, the
    union of terminating rewrite systems is not necessarily
    terminating.  Nevertheless, under certain restrictions, modularity
    of termination can be recovered %~\cite{Gramlich12}%.

    On the other hand, the preservation of strong normalisation
    property (PSN) is known to be not satisfied for some calculi with
    explicit substitutions %\cite{Mellies95,Gu99}%. A calculus with
    explicit substitutions %\cite{Lins86,ACCL91,kes09}% presents some
    formalisation for the substitution operation, defined as a
    meta-operation in the $\lambda$-calculus. In other words, for
    rule $(\lambda{x}. M) N \to_{\beta} M [x:=N]$ in such a calculus, $M [x:=N]$
    represents a term where the substitution is
    defined through a small-step semantics. PSN property in this
    context guarantees that any strongly normalising,
    i.e. terminating, term in the $\lambda$-calculus is also strongly
    normalising in the calculus with explicit substitutions.
 
    The Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem states the conditions for
    the union of two reduction relations over a set $A$ to be PSN
    through its relation of simulation to a reduction relation over
    some set $B$ (cf. %~\cite{LengrandPhD,kes09}%). In particular,
    when the reduction relation over $B$ is terminating and the
    simulation relation is complete, the theorem guarantees that both
    reductions over $A$ are terminating and so its union, i.e. that
    termination is modular.

    We present in this work a constructive proof of the Modular Strong
    Normalisation Theorem in the Coq Proof Assistant
    %~\cite{CoqTeam}%. The proof is entirely constructive in the sense
    that no classical reasoning is used, i.e. the law of excluded
    middle, proofs by contradiction or any equivalent inference
    rule. This is interesting from the computational point of view
    since the algorithmic content of proofs can automatically be
    extracted as certified code %~\cite{Let2008}%. Eventhough no code
    extraction is executed in the present work, it takes part in a
    project to certify the proofs of %~\cite{kes09}%, aiming to
    extract certified code. The choice of Coq as the formalisation
    tool is natural since the underlying logic behind the calculus of
    inductive constructions, the theory over which Coq is developed,
    is also constructive %\cite{Paulin93,wernerPhD}%.

    A constructive proof of the Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem
    is presented by S. Lengrand in %\cite{LengrandPhD}% and some of
    the basic notions used in this proof, such as strong
    normalisation, is already formalised in Coq
    %\cite{lengrand-nt}%. In a certain sense, this work can be seen as
    a non-trivial expansion of the normalisation theory formalised by
    Lengrand. In fact, the strong normalisation property defined in
    %\cite{LengrandPhD}% uses a specialized inductive principle that
    should hold for all predicate, i.e. through a second order
    formula. On the other hand, in this work we use only the standard
    inductive definition of the strong normalisation property
    (cf. %\cite{kes09,LengrandPhD,Raams-phd}%), and we also prove the
    equivalence between these definitions. In this way, we understand
    that we achieved a simpler and straighforward formalisation. The
    proof of the Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem follows the
    ideas in Lengrand's PhD thesis, but to the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first formalisation of this theorem.

    The contributions of this work are summarised below.

    %\begin{itemize}

      \item We provide a complete formalisation of the constructive
      normalisation theory based on the simulation technique developed
      in \cite{LengrandPhD}. In particular:

      \begin{itemize}

      \item We built a constructive proof of the
            Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem, and

      \item We proved the equivalence between Lengrand's definition of
            strong normalisation and the standard inductive definition
            of strong normalisation.
            
      \end{itemize} \end{itemize}%

     This paper is built up from a Coq script where some code is
     hidden for the sake of clarity of this document. The
     formalisation is compatible with Coq 8.8.0. All the files
     concerning this work are freely available in the repository %{\tt

(** * The Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem *)

(** In this section, we present the Modular Strong Normalisation
    Theorem whose formalisation will be detailed in the next
    section. This is an abstract theorem about termination of
    reduction relations through the well known simulation technique
    %\cite{BN98}%. In order to fix notation, let [A] and [B] be
    sets. A relation from [A] to [B] is a subset of $A\times B$. If
    $R$ is a relation from [A] to [B] then we write $R\ a\ b$ instead
    of $(a,b) \in R$, and in this case, we say that $a$ %{\it
    reduces}% to $b$. Using arrows to denote relations and $\to$ being
    a relation from [A] to [B] then $\leftarrow$ denotes the inverse
    relation from [B] to [A]. If $\to_1$ is a relation from $A$ to
    $B$, and $\to_2$ is a relation from $B$ to $C$ then the
    composition of $\to_1$ with $\to_2$, written $\to_1\cdot \to_2$,
    is a relation from $A$ to $C$. A relation from a set to itself is
    a %{\it reduction relation over a set}%, i.e. a reduction relation
    over A is a subset of $A\times A$. If $\to_A$ is a reduction
    relation over $A$, then a %{\it reduction sequence}% is a sequence
    of the form $a_0 \to_A a_1 \to_A a_2 \to_A \ldots$ A reduction
    sequence $a_0 \to_A a_1 \to_A a_2 \to_A \ldots \to_A a_n\ (n\geq
    0)$ is a $n$-step reduction from $a_0$. A reduction sequence is
    finite if it is a $n$-step reduction for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
    and infinite otherwise. We write $\to_A^+$ (resp. $\to_A^*$) for
    the transitive (resp. reflexive transitive) closure of $\to_A$.
    
    An element $a\in A$ is %{\it strongly normalising}% w.r.t. $\to_A$
    if every reduction sequence starting from $a$ is finite, and in
    this case we write $a \in SN^{\to_A}$. Usually, this idea is
    expressed inductively as follows: %\begin{equation}\label{def:sn}
    a \in {SN}^{\to_A} \mbox{ iff } \forall b, (a \to_A b \mbox{
    implies } b \in {SN}^{\to_A}) \end{equation}% *)
(*
%\noindent% whose Coq code is given by
[[
Inductive SN_ind {A:Type} (red: Red A) (a:A): Prop :=
  | sn_acc: (forall b, red a b -> SN_ind red b) -> SN_ind red a.
]]
A few comments about Coq are at a place. In the above definition, [Inductive] is the reserved word for inductive definitions. It is followed by the name of the definition, which in our case is [SN_ind], and it has three arguments: [{A:Type}], [(red:Red A)] and [(a:A)]. The first argument appears between curly brackets, which means that it is  %{\it implicit}%. Implicit arguments are types of polymorphic functions that can be inferred from the context. The second argument corresponds to a reduction relation [red] over [A], and the third argument is an element of [A]. This definition has one constructor named [sn_acc] whose content corresponds exactly to the definition given in (%\ref{def:sn}%). In this way, in order to prove that a certain element [a:A] is strongly normalising w.r.t. a reduction relation $\to_r$, one has to build a proof of the formula $\forall b, a \to_r b \to SN\_ind \to_r b$.*)

(** In order to present the theorem, we need to define the notions of
strong and weak simulation. In the following definitions $A$ and $B$
are arbitrary sets:

    %\begin{definition}\label{def:sws} Let $\to$ be a relation from
     $A$ to $B$, $\to_A$ be a reduction relation over $A$ and $\to_B$
     be a reduction relation over $B$. The reduction relation $\to_B$
     {\it strongly} (resp. {\it weakly}) simulates $\to_A$ through
     $\to$ if $(\leftarrow \cdot \to_A) \subseteq (\to_B^+ \cdot
     \leftarrow)$ (resp. $(\leftarrow \cdot \to_A) \subseteq (\to_B^*
     \cdot \leftarrow)$).

    In what follows, we present the Modular Strong Normalisation
    Theorem and a draft of its proof. In addition, we highligth in
    %{\color{blue}blue}% the name of the auxiliary results established
    in the formalisation detailed in the next section.

    %\begin{theorem}[Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem]
      
      \noindent Let $\to$ be a relation from $A$ to $B$, $\to_1$ and
      $\to_2$ be two reduction relations over $A$, and $\to_B$ be a
      reduction relation over $B$. Suppose that:

      \begin{enumerate}

        \item\label{hip:one} $\to_B$ strongly simulates $\to_1$
                             through $\to$;

        \item\label{hip:two} $\to_B$ weakly simulates $\to_2$ through
                             $\to$;
      
        \item\label{hip:three} $A \subseteq SN^{\to_2}$.

      \end{enumerate}

      Then $\leftarrow ({SN}^{\to_B}) \subseteq {SN}^{\to_1 \cup
      \to_2}$. In other words, $$\forall a:A, a\in\, \leftarrow
      ({SN}^{\to_B}) \mbox{ implies } a \in {SN}^{\to_1\cup \to_2}.$$
      \end{theorem}%

      This proof follows the lines of %\cite{LengrandPhD}%, but using
      the standard definition $SN$ in (%\ref{def:sn}%). First of all,
      hypothesis %\ref{hip:one}% and %\ref{hip:two}% allow us to
      conclude that the composition $(\to_2^* \cdot \to_1)$ is
      strongly simulated by $\to_B$: in fact, from hypothesis
      %\ref{hip:two}% we have that $\to_2^*$ is weakly simulated by
      $\to_B$ %{\color{blue}({\it SimulWeakReflTrans})}%.  In
      addition, the composition of two reduction relations that are,
      respectively, strongly and weakly simulated by the same
      reduction relation is strongly simulated by this reduction
      relation %{\color{blue}({\it WeakStrongSimul})}%. Therefore,
      $(\to_2^* \cdot \to_1)$ is strongly simulated by $\to_B$ through
      $\to$ %{\color{blue}({\it RCSimul})}%, that together with the
      fact that $a\in \leftarrow({SN}^{\to_B})$ allow us to conclude
      that $a \in {SN}^{\to_2^* \cdot \to_1}$ %{\color{blue}({\it
      SNbySimul})}%.  Now, from hypothesis %\ref{hip:three}%, we have
      $a \in {SN}^{\to_2}$, and we conclude from the fact that
      ${SN}^{\to_2^* \cdot \to_1} \cap {SN}^{\to_2} = {SN}^{\to_1\cup
      \to_2}$ %{\color{blue}({\it SNunion})}%. *)

(** * The Formalisation *)

(** In this section we present the formalisation details of the
    Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem in the Coq Proof
    Assistant. The first important point is that our proof is
    constructive, i.e. it does not use classical reasoning such as the
    law of excluded middle, double negation elimination or proof by
    contradiction.

    In terms of notation, sets are coded as arbitrary types in such a
    way that the membership relation $a \in A$ ($a$ is an element of
    the set $A$) is represented as $a:A$ ($a$ has type $A$). Also,
    n-ary predicates and functions are defined in a curryfied version
    (cf. %\cite{Geu09}%).

    We start with some basic definitions in order to make Coq notation
    clear%\footnote{This paper is written directly from a Coq script
    file, therefore, the Coq code presented is the real code of the
    formalisation.}%. A relation from $A$ to $B$ is defined as a
    binary predicate: *)

Definition Rel (A B : Type) := A -> B -> Prop.
(** %\noindent% In this definition, [Rel] receives two types as
    arguments, and return the signature of a relation from $A$ to $B$,
    i.e. the type [A -> B -> Prop]. As mentioned before, if $A=B$ then we
    have a %{\it reduction relation}%: *)

Definition Red (A : Type) := Rel A A.
(** Given two relations [R1] and [R2] from [A] to [B], if every pair
    of elements in [R1] is also in [R2] then we say that [R1] is a
    subrelation of [R2]: *)

Definition Sub {A B} (R1 R2: Rel A B) : Prop := forall a b, R1 a b -> R2 a b.
(** In the above definition, [A] and [B] first appear between curly
    brackets, which means that these arguments are %{\it
    implicit}%. Implicit arguments are types of polymorphic functions
    that can be inferred from the context. Therefore, [Sub] requires
    two relations as arguments, and Coq automatically infers its
    type. A more convenient notation can be easily defined for objects
    we are constructing. In the [Sub] predicate case we define an
    infix notation as follows: *)

Notation "R1 <# R2" := (Sub R1 R2) (at level 50).
(** Now one can write [R1 <# R2] instead of [Sub R1 R2]. In addition,
    in order to avoid parsing ambiguity, a precedence level ranging
    from 0 to 100 can be provided.

    Given two relations, say [red1] from [A] to [B] and [red2] from
    [B] to [C], one can build a new relation from [A] to [C] by
    composing its steps: *)

Inductive comp {A B C} (red1: Rel A B)(red2: Rel B C) : Rel A C :=
  compose: forall b a c,  red1 a b -> red2 b c -> comp red1 red2 a c.
Notation "R1 # R2" := (comp R1 R2) (at level 40).
(* begin hide *)
Arguments compose {A B C red1 red2} _ _ _ _ _ .
(* end hide *)
(** %\noindent% Note that [comp] is defined inductively. The inductive
    definition [comp] has just one constructor named [compose] that
    explicitly builds the composite relation from [A] to [C] from the
    given relations [red1] and [red2]. In addition, it is important to
    know that Coq automatically generates an inductive principle for
    every inductive definition. For instance, the natural numbers
    %{\tt nat}% are inductively defined as: %\begin{alltt} Inductive
    nat : Set := O : nat | S : nat \(\to\) nat \end{alltt}%

    %\noindent% The corresponding induction principle, named %{\tt
    nat\_ind}\footnote{The name of the automatic induction principle
    generated follows the pattern {\tt name\_ind}, i.e. the name of
    the inductive definition followed by the string {\tt \_ind}.}%, is
    given by %\begin{alltt} forall P : nat \(\to\) Prop, P 0 \(\to\)
    (forall n : nat, P n \(\to\) P (S n)) \(\to\) forall n : nat, P n
    \end{alltt}%

    Therefore, in order to prove that a certain property %{\tt P}%
    holds for all %{\tt n: nat}%, one needs to prove that %{\tt (P
    0)}% holds, and that if %{\tt (P n)}% holds then %{\tt (P (S n))}%
    also holds. In general, if %{\tt def}% is an inductive definition
    with constructors %{\tt c1}%, %{\tt c2}%, %\ldots%, %{\tt ck}%
    then, in order to prove that a property %{\tt P}% holds for every
    element defined by %{\tt def}%, we need to show, in a certain
    sense, that %{\tt P}% is compatible with each of its
    constructors. A more precise and detailed explanation about Coq
    induction principles can be found, for instance, in
    %\cite{CoqTeam,BC04,cpdt,Pierce:SF}%.

    The inverse of a relation from [A] to [B] is inductively defined
    as the corresponding relation from [B] to [A]: *)

Inductive inverse {A B} (R: Rel A B) : Rel B A :=
  inverseof: forall a b, R a b -> inverse R b a.
(** The transitive closure of a reduction relation [red] over [A] is
    constructed, as usual, by adding to [red] all possible reductions
    with at least one step starting from each $a\in A$: *)

Inductive trans {A} (red: Red A) : Red A :=
| singl: forall a b,  red a b -> trans red a b
| transit: forall b a c,  red a b -> trans red b c -> trans red a c.
(* begin hide *)
Arguments transit {A} {red} _ _ _ _ _ .
(* end hide *)
(** Therefore, it is straightforward from this definition that a
    reduction relation is included in its transitive closure: *)

(* begin hide *)
Proof.
  unfold Sub.
  intros a b H.
  apply singl; assumption.

(* end hide *)
(** The reflexive transitive closure of a reduction relation is
    obtained from its transitive closure by adding reflexivity,
    i.e. by adding the fact that each element of the relation reduces
    to itself in 0 steps: *)

Inductive refltrans {A} (red: Red A) : Red A :=
| reflex: forall a,  refltrans red a a
| atleast1: forall a b,  trans red a b -> refltrans red a b.
(* begin hide *)
Lemma tailtransit {A red}: forall (b a c:A),  trans red a b -> trans red b c -> trans red a c.

    * assumption.
  + apply (transit b).
    * exact H.
    * apply IHtrans in H2; exact H2.

(* end hide *)
(** The image of a predicate via a relation is inductively defined as
    follows: *)

Inductive Image {A B} (R:Rel A B)(P: A -> Prop): B -> Prop :=
  image: forall a b, P a -> R a b -> Image R P b.
(* begin hide *)
Arguments image {A B R P} _ _ _ _.
(* end hide *)
(** The notions of weak and strong simulation of reduction relations
    are a straightforward translation to the Coq language
    (cf. Definition %\ref{def:sws}%): *)

Definition WeakSimul {A B} (redA: Red A) (redB: Red B) (R: Rel A B) := 
  ((inverse R) # redA) <# ((refltrans redB) # (inverse R)).

Definition StrongSimul {A B} (redA: Red A) (redB: Red B) (R: Rel A B) := 
  ((inverse R) # redA) <# ((trans redB) # (inverse R)).

(** ** Equivalence between strongly normalising definitions *)

(** In this section, we prove the equivalence between Lengrand's
    definition of strong normalisation, denoted by [SN], and the
    inductive definition presented in (%\ref{def:sn}%), here denoted
    by [SN_ind]. In his PhD thesis, Lengrand develops a constructive
    theory of normalisation in the sense that it does not rely on
    classical logic. In this theory, the notion of strong
    normalisation for reduction relations is defined by a second-order
    formula which is based on a stability predicate called
    [patriarchal] (cf. %\cite{LengrandPhD,lengSNInd05}%). *)

Definition patriarchal {A} (red:Red A) (P:A -> Prop): Prop
  := forall x, (forall y, red x y -> P y) -> P x.

(** In this way, one says that a predicate [P] over [A] is patriarchal
    w.r.t. a reduction relation [red] over [A], if ([P a]) holds
    whenever ([P b]) holds for every [red]-reduct [b] of [a]. Now, an
    element [a] is strongly normalising w.r.t. to the reduction
    relation [red], when [P a] holds for every patriarchal predicate
    [P] w.r.t. reduction relation [red]: *)

Definition SN {A:Type} (red:Red A) (a:A): Prop
  := forall P, patriarchal red P -> P a.
(** Most of the Coq code presented so far can be found at
%\cite{lengrand-nt}%. Nevertheless, our proof code is different since
library [ssreflect] is not used in the present development.

    The definition bellow corresponds to the usual inductive
    definition of strong normalisation for reduction relations given
    in (%\ref{def:sn}%): *)

Inductive SN' {A:Type} (red: Red A) (a:A): Prop :=
  sn_acc: (forall b, red a b -> SN' red b) -> SN' red a.
(** So, given an element [a:A] and a reduction relation [red] over
    [A], [a] is strongly normalising w.r.t. [red] if every one-step
    [red]-reduct [b] of [a] is strongly normalising w.r.t. [red]. This
    means that in order to conclude that [SN' red a], one has to prove
    first that [(forall b, red a b -> SN' red b)]. In addition, note that
    predicate [SN' red] is patriarchal, and hence it is
    straightforward that [SN] implies [SN'], i.e. that [SN' red a]
    holds, whenever [SN red a] holds for all [a], and every reduction
    relation over [A]. Note that formally, this inductive definition
    gives only one direction of the biconditional (%\ref{def:sn}%),
    but the other direction is straightforward: *)
  
Lemma SNstable {A} {red: Red A}: forall a, SN' red a ->
                                      forall b, red a b -> SN' red b.
Proof.
  intros a HSN b Hred.
  inversion HSN; clear HSN.
  apply H; assumption. 
Qed.
(** This proof does the analysis of the definition [SN'] in order
    to match the hypothesis [SN' red a], named [HSN], through the
    [inversion] tactic, that (informally) replaces the hypothesis
    [(SN' red a)] by the information it contains about it. In this
    case, the known information comes from the definition of [SN'] 
    and exactly what we need to prove. *)

(** The induction principle automatically generated for [SN'],
    called [SN'_ind], is as follows:

    %\begin{alltt} forall (A : Type) (red : Red A) (P : A -> Prop),
    (forall c : A, (forall b : A, red c b -> SN' red b) -> (forall

    for any strongly normalising element [a], we need to prove that

(** ** The Main Theorem *)

(** In this section, we present the formal proof main steps of the
    Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem. The proof depends on some
    results explained in what follows. The first result concerns the
    composition of weakly and strongly simulated reductions. More
    precisely, if a reduction relation [redB] weakly simulates a
    reduction relation [redA1] through [R], and strongly simulates the
    reduction relation [redA2] through [R] then [redB] strongly
    simulates the composition ([redA1 # redA2]) through [R]. This result
    is intuitively clear, but formal/mechanical proofs of even clear
    results requires a large amount of details that we decided to
    explain its steps. *)

(** * Conclusion *)

(** In this work we presented a constructive formalisation of the
    Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem in the Coq Proof
    Assistant. The proof is constructive in the sense that it does not
    use the principle of excluded middle or any other classical rule,
    such as proof by contradiction. The constructive approach is not
    the standard way to prove termination of a reduction relation. In
    fact, the usual technique to prove termination of a reduction
    relation is showing that it does not have infinite reduction
    sequences through a proof by contradiction
    (cf. %\cite{terese03,BN98}%). For instance, a classical proof of
    the Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem is presented at
    %\cite{kes09}%. Constructive proofs are usually more difficult and
    elaborate than classical ones, but the former are preferred in the
    context of Computer Science.

    The Modular Strong Normalisation Theorem is an abstract result
    that states the conditions for the union of two reduction
    relations to preserve strong normalisation (PSN). It is a
    non-trivial result in abstract reduction systems that uses the
    well-known technique of termination by simulation, i.e. the
    termination of a reduction system is obtained by simulating its
    steps via another reduction relation known to be terminating. The
    theorem is, for instance, applied in %\cite{kes09}% to establish
    the PSN property of a calculus with explicit substitutions.

    The proofs developed in this formalisation follow the ideas
    presented in %\cite{LengrandPhD}%, where a theory of constructive
    normalisation is developed. This theory is based on a different
    definition of strong normalisation. Instead of using Lengrand's
    definition, we used a more standard inductive definition of strong
    normalisation (cf. %\cite{kes09,LengrandPhD,Raams-phd}%). A formal
    proof of the equivalence between these definitions of strong
    normalisation is also provided. In this way, we have a simpler and
    straithforward formalisation of the constructive normalisation
    theory. *)

    (*
       
       An interesting application of the Modular Strong Normalisation
       Theorem is given in %\cite{kes09}% to establish the termination
       of a calculus with explicit substitutions. Termination of
       calculus with explicit substitutions is a challenging problem
       that...
